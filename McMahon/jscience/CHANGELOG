=========================================================

! many changes from 1.00 were not tracked, but some highlights are:

Files added:

- jio.h/.cpp : Some file input / output manipulation
- jmath_geometry.h/.cpp : Geometric structures (triangles, etc) and classes, and subroutines to calculate properties of geometrical shapes (e.g. simplex coordinates of triangles and tetrahedra)
- jplanewave.h/.cpp : Plane waves used in JFEM3D. 

Files modified:

- jmath_vector.h/.cpp : complex<double> vector class added
